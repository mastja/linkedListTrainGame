** Description:  Simulation class header file for the Save Your Family Train Game -
**			  Final project - CS 162.  This program create a doubly-linked list
**			  data structure consisting of Space objects.  The space class is an
**			  abstract parent class.  Room classes and functions are derived from
**			  the space class.  The program allows
**			  the user to play a game where they move through spaces and collect
**			  people class objects, in an attempt to make it to the last space with
**			  the key objects.  This class holds the simulation function which
**			  runs the game simulation.
